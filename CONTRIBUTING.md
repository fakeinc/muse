# Guidelines for contributing to this project
First, thank you for your interest and help for this project! It's not possible that 
## Improving existing stuff
Something you need not on [this list of supported languages](https://github.com/fakeinc/muse#supported-languages-plugins-) or any color scheme (or theme) not optimized for any of these? Feel free to submit an issue or pull request.
## Adding new color schemes/themes
### Requirements
#### Color schemes
1. Make sure that your color scheme is optimized for all of the major languages in [this list of supported languages](https://github.com/fakeinc/muse#supported-languages-plugins-). By major languages, I mean the first 26 languages of that list.
2. Give different enough highlighting for different entries that may cause confusion when placed together.
3. The contrast to the background is enough that everything can be easily seen.
4. Consistance between languages. For example, you shouldn't have different highlighting for `String`s in Python and Java. Some exceptions are allowed if clearly explained.
5. If it is a folk of other color schemes, more than half of the original color scheme should be changed. Please respect the license of the original author.
6. Color scheme is elegant and does not have an overall negative impact on user's mind.
### Flow
1. Double check the requirements. Pull requests not satisfying the requirements cannot be accepted immediately and need some discussion and rework.
2. When the requirements are satisfied, this pull request will be accepted.
