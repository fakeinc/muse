## Included themes
### Muse
#### Description
* The meta theme. It's edited on top of the default theme of Intellij Idea, but I've changed every entry I can think of.
* It makes every highlighting meaningful. You'll find out that every similar highlights' category is similar. Don't worry, their difference are still easy to recognize.
#### Showcase

#### Recommended setup
##### Intellij
* Disable sematic highlighting as it may cause confusion. However, it still tries to optimize it. So do not hesitate to enable it if you are adapted to it.
* Use plugin [Rainbow Brackets](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10080-rainbow-brackets).
